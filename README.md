# WeatherApp
Using <a href="geodb-free-service.wirefreethought.com">this</a> API  we get access to similar cities (entered via input)
and using <a href="goweather.herokuapp.com"> this</a> API (<a href="https://github.com/robertoduessmann/weather-api">link to github page</a>) we display the weather about the city for the current and next few days. You can search for cities, view the weather for the city, add and remove from bookmarks.
So you can:
<ul>
<li>switching themes (dark/light);</li>
<li>search for a city;</li>
<li>getting the weather;</li>
<li>add/delete city to/from bookmarks;</li>
<li>filtering a city in bookmarks by its weather;</li>
<li>sorting cities in the search area;</li>
</ul>
